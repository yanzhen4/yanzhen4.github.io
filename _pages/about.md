Miscellany

I was born and raised in Beijing, China. I graduated from The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, typically taking on the Swingman position, with a three-pointer shooting percentage over 50% and a free throw percentage over 90%.
I served as the starting Small Forward of our high school basketball team. 

I also enjoy reading history and am a huge fan of the Napoleonic Wars. My favorite figure is [Marshal Lannes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lannes)
