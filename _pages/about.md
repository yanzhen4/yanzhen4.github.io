I am a third-year undergraduate student in UIUC majoring in Computer Science.
I am passionate about Machine Learning Research, and are currently participating in research and projects.
I have become a member of the Data Mining Group (DMG) since Spring 2023, where I am fortuante to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/), and be mentored by [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhimanhua.github.io/). 

My current research interests are Data Mining / Natural Language Processing, specifically text mining.

I hope to make friends with other undergraduate students interested in AI Research. Feel free to reach out to me!
