I am an incoming master's student at Stanford's MSCS program. 

Prior to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. degree at UIUC, advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/). 
I was also fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Yu Zhang](https://yuzhimanhua.github.io/), who was a PhD student in Prof. Jiawei Han's group.

During my undergraduate study, I visited UPenn, working with [Prof. Dan Roth](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~danroth/), where I was also mentored by [Sihao Chen](https://sihaoc.github.io/).
