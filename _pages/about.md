I am an undergraduate student at UIUC majoring in Computer Science.

I have been a member of the Data Mining Group (DMG) since Spring 2023, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and mentored by [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhimanhua.github.io/). 

In 2024, I had a wonderful summer at UPenn, where I was researching with [Prof. Dan Roth](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~danroth/).

Starting in Fall 2024, I will start working with [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/). 

My current research interests are Data Mining and Natural Language Processing.
