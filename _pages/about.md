I am an incoming Master student at Stanford's MSCS program. 

Prior to Stanford, I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jiaxuan/). 
I also visited the University of Pennsylvania in Summer 2024, working with [Prof. Dan Roth](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~danroth/).

I am also fortunate to be mentored by [Yu Zhang](https://yuzhimanhua.github.io/) in UIUC and by [Sihao Chen](https://sihaoc.github.io/) in UPenn.

I am a recipient of Honorable Mention of the 2025 CRA Outstanding Undergrad Researcher Award.
